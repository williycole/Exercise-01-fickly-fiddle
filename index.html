                    Fiddle leaf figs, or ficus lyrata, love to be fed! Their large leaves and relatively fast growth demand plenty of 
                    nutrition. But how often should you fertilize? The rate that you should fertilize your fiddle leaf fig depends on 
                    the season you’re in, how fast you want your plant to grow, and the type of fertilizer you are using.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Plants often suffer because of under-fertilization, which leads to slow growth and yellowing leaves. Proper 
                    fertilization will give your plant the best health and keep it deep green and gorgeous. Let’s expand more on 
                    each of these factors now.

                <p>
                    But before we start, keep in mind that as pre-requisite for growth, you must keep your plant in ideal growing 
                    conditions light and water-wise. An unhealthy plant that’s fighting for its life, that’s overwatered or dried-out, 
                    is not going to grow, no matter how much fertilizer you add. Follow the tips on this blog to help you with 
                    all things plant care if you need it. See The Basics of Fiddle Leaf Fig Tree Care as a starting point for ficus 
                    lyrata specific tips, or the universal advice on How to Water your Indoor Plants the Right Way, which covers all

                            Houseplants are most active during the spring and summer because of the abundance of light. 
                            Fertilization is most important during these times. Your fiddle leaf plant is begging for
                            nutrients and cannot grow and prosper without them.

                            All fiddle leaf fig plants need nutrients, whether they are actively growing or not. But those that 
                            are growing a lot will deplete their soil of nutrients more quickly. Your fertilizing schedule depends 
                            on how fast you’d like your plant to grow.
                        </p>

                            If you have a young plant that you’d like to grow quickly, you can fertilize with our custom-formulated
                            Fiddle Leaf Fig Plant Food each and every time you water. This ensures that your plant gets a gentle but 
                            steady supply of the nutrition it needs. Fiddle leaf figs can grow 12 to 18 inches each year when fed
                            properly and given an abundance of natural light!

                            Understanding a bit about what happens inside the potting mix of your houseplant can help you care for 
                            it better. As always, I’m going to be using simple terms to explain the concepts, so you don’t need 
                            to have an MA in horticultural science. The web of roots of the plant constitutes its main feeding organ,
                            where it receives all the nutrients it needs to live and grow properly.

                            <h2>THE POTTING MIX IS A RESERVOIR OF NUTRIENTS</h2>
                        </li>
                        <p>
                            When you buy a plant, the potting mix comes full of nutrients (the natural nutrients in the soil plus 
                            these little capsules added to the potting mix by the grower). The soil contains three vital natural 
                            elements for the plant: K, N, and P. These basic elements are responsible for leaf vitality, root health,
                            and even flower blooms. The ideal proportion of each element depends on the species of your plant. After 
                            ending up in our homes, the plant keeps eating the nutrients out from the soil, but nutrients don’t get 
                            replenished until you either you add fertilizer, add soil to top-up, or repot into fresh soil. The plant 
                            needs more nutrients when it’s growing new leaves, or expanding the roots. The right amount depends on 
                            the season.
