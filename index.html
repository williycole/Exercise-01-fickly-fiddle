            <p>
                Fiddle leaf figs, or ficus lyrata, love to be fed! Their large leaves and relatively fast growth demand
                plenty of
                nutrition. But how often should you fertilize? The rate that you should fertilize your fiddle leaf fig
                depends on
                the season you’re in, how fast you want your plant to grow, and the type of fertilizer you are using.
            </p>

            <p>
                Plants often suffer because of under-fertilization, which leads to slow growth and yellowing leaves.
                Proper
                fertilization will give your plant the best health and keep it deep green and gorgeous. Let’s expand
                more on
                each of these factors now.
            </p>

            <p>
                But before we start, keep in mind that as pre-requisite for growth, you must keep your plant in ideal
                growing
                conditions light and water-wise. An unhealthy plant that’s fighting for its life, that’s overwatered or
                dried-out,
                is not going to grow, no matter how much fertilizer you add. Follow the tips on this blog to help you
                with
                all things plant care if you need it. See The Basics of Fiddle Leaf Fig Tree Care as a starting point

                    <p>
                        Houseplants are most active during the spring and summer because of the abundance of light.
                        Fertilization is most important during these times. Your fiddle leaf plant is begging for
                        nutrients and cannot grow and prosper without them.

                        All fiddle leaf fig plants need nutrients, whether they are actively growing or not. But those
                        that
                        are growing a lot will deplete their soil of nutrients more quickly. Your fertilizing schedule
                        depends
                        on how fast you’d like your plant to grow.

                        each and every time you water. This ensures that your
                        plant gets a
                        gentle but
                        steady supply of the nutrition it needs. Fiddle leaf figs can grow 12 to 18 inches each year
                        when fed
                        properly and given an abundance of natural light!

                        (available on Amazon now), most fiddle leaf fig owners are first time plant owners! This creates
                        a tricky situation, since ficus lyrata can be particular about their needs.

                    <p class="less-padding"> When you buy a plant, the potting mix comes full of nutrients (the natural
                        nutrients in the soil
                        plus
                        these little capsules added to the potting mix by the grower). The soil contains three vital
                        natural
                        elements for the plant: K, N, and P. These basic elements are responsible for leaf vitality,
                        root health,
                        and even flower blooms. The ideal proportion of each element depends on the species of your
                        plant. After
                        ending up in our homes, the plant keeps eating the nutrients out from the soil, but nutrients
                        don’t get
                        replenished until you either you add fertilizer, add soil to top-up, or repot into fresh soil.
                        The plant
                        needs more nutrients when it’s growing new leaves, or expanding the roots. The right amount
                        depends on
                        the season.
